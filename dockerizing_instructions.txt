========== Dockerizing with Dockerfile ==========

Create Dockerfile with the following contents:

FROM java:8-jdk-alpine

COPY ./target/<name_of_jar_file> /usr/app/

WORKDIR /usr/app

RUN sh -c 'touch <name_of_jar_file>'

ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","<name_of_jar_file>"]



Navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile resides and run this command:
$ docker build -t <name_of_your_image> .
We built the image using docker build. We gave it a name with the -t flag and specified the current directory where the Dockerfile is. The image is built and stored in our local docker registry.



Run the image with this command:
$ docker run -p 8090:8080  <name_of_your_image>

We know that each container is an isolated environment in itself and we have to map the port of the host operating system - 8090 and the port inside the container - 8080, which is specified as the -p 8090:8080 argument.
